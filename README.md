# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
If I were a freelance web developer, I would want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I would not have to pay a graphic designer. I learned how to create functiond and properties that inherit parent classes for reuse of code, and how to run backend tests with render methods.

## Installation
In order to install the application, users will need to download Node.js and VS Code. Within VS Code, install inquirer, jest, and SVG previewer. 

## Usage
Start the application in the integrated terminal, run node index.js, and that will prompt the user to input the shape, the color of the shape, 3 characters for the logo, and the color of the text. Once entered, the application will generate an SVG logo in a logo.svg file to be previewed.
